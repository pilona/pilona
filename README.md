I'm Alex Pilon, a software engineering graduate and developer.

I'm not available for hire, but you may often find me at [Ottawa Python
(OPAG)][opag] meetings, [Low Level Linux Users Group of Ottawa (L3GO)][l3go],
occasionally at the [#ottbikesocial], or once in a blue moon on the suckless
mailing list.

## The other Alex Pilons ##

Please don't confuse me with:

- [alexpilon.com][com] (both know or known by Marc Lennox and
  both have a motorcycle license and rode 250 CCs at some point), but he has a
  “cooler” profile pic on his blog, has more memorable company names on his
  [LinkedIn][com-in], and rocks almost as sick of a beard as I used to have.

- [Alex Pilon from UOttawa][me-in] (formerly <alexpilon.me>), works at *the*
  Hashicorp (as in Vault, Consult, Terraform, and Vagrant), and is a year or
  two younger than I. We met at CUSEC 2014 only because I introduced myself to
  his classmate and he didn't believe me. Methinks CUSEC's draw system should
  have used IDs, not names without considering the different `UNIQUE`ness
  needs.

We're all in Ottawa **and** software development, but we're not the same.
